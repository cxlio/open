# Open Source Libraries and Tools

This repository contains a collection of modular lightweight libraries designed for efficient and maintainable code.

## Core Principles

These libraries are guided by the following principles to ensure quality and consistency:

1. Each library includes clear documentationâ€”covering purpose, usage examples, API references, and installation steps.
2. Libraries are designed to be self-contained, avoiding unnecessary external dependencies.
3. Consistent naming conventions and API design are followed across all tools.
4. Each library comes with thorough unit and integration tests.
5. Versioning adheres to semantic versioning guidelines.
