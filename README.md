# Open Source Libraries and Tools

This repository contains a collection of modular lightweight libraries designed for efficient and maintainable code.

## Core Principles

All libraries follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and reliability.

1. Comprehensive documentation: Each tool/library should have clear explanations of its purpose, usage examples, API references, and installation instructions.
2. Modular and Independent: Each tool/library should be as self-contained as possible, with no external dependencies.
3. Consistent API/Interface: A consistent API design and naming conventions.
4. Testable: Comprehensive unit and integration tests for each tool/library.
5. Versioned: Use semantic versioning.
6. Easy to Use: Make the tools/libraries easy to integrate into existing projects.
